## Loan Default Prediction

This project predicts the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan using **Machine Learning** techniques.  
The goal is to help financial institutions assess risk and make better lending decisions.

---

## Project Overview
- Dataset contains loan-related features such as income, loan amount, credit history, etc.
- Built and evaluated models to predict default probability.
- Compared multiple machine learning algorithms for accuracy and performance.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** (for visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning models)
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## How to Run
Open the notebook `LOAN DEFAULT PREDICTION 2025.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis and results.


## Results
- Achieved high prediction accuracy with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- Found that credit history and income are strong indicators of loan repayment ability.

## Future Improvements
- Use advanced ensemble models (XGBoost, LightGBM).
- Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.
- Deploy as a web app for real-time predictions.
